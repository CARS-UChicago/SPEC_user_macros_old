-  The standard spec macros are
   /usr/lib/spec.d/standard.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/psic.mac
   /usr/lib/spec.d/kapp.mac

- These are only read at fresh start

- Note that these macros are replaced when spec is re-installed
  therefore dont edit these files or the changes will be lost

- The below macro files are not replaced during a new installation 
  and can be used for defining/replacing macros

      /usr/lib/spec.d/site_f.mac        (read only when starting fresh)
      /usr/lib/spec.d/site.mac          (read each time each user starts)
      /usr/lib/spec.d/spec/conf.mac     (spec= kappa, psic, sixc, spec, etc.)
                                        (this is read every time spec starts)
      /usr/lib/spec.d/spec/spec.mac     (spec= kappa, psic, sixc, spec, etc.)
                                        (read only when starting fresh)
      ./spec.mac                        (relative to start up directory)

- The following macro files have been created:
      
1.  /usr/lib/spec.d/site_f.mac
   This file simply points to:

2.  /home/specadm/user_macros/site_startup.mac
   This file calls the below macros and sets up some defs
   
3.  Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/site_user.mac
    to add/replace standard macros  

4.  Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/point_scans1.mac
    to edit scan stuff which is dependant on point scanning

5.  Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/traj_scans1.mac
    to edit scan stuff which is dependant on traj scanning

6.  Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/kappa_user.mac
    to add/replace macros for kappa

7.  Use the file /home/specadm/user_macros/psic_user.mac
    to add/replace macros for psic
  
-  Note before defining a macro type lsdef in spec to see
   if the name is already defined
